<TITLE>PART 4: READING COMPREHENSION / DIRECTIONS: Read the passage carefully and choose the correct answer. (Question 26 to 30)

<TEXT>
If you ever go into a house in Japan, you must remember to take off your shoes. These would damage the fine straw mats which cover the floors. 
The rooms in most Japanese houses are usually large. In the middle of the room, there may be a low table with small flat cushions around it. Many houses have no other furniture in their rooms. Perhaps you will see a bowl of flowers or a long silk painting on one of the walls. Visitors are given a small cup of green tea. 
You may be surprised to see that there are no bedrooms. The Japanese unroll their beds and put them on the floor when they fell tired. Japanese people take a bath before their evening meals. Most houses have one large bath for the whole family. However, no one washes in the bath! They wash themselves before they go into the big bath. The water is very hot. But the Japanese are used to having hot baths. After the bath, they put on a loose robe and eat their evening meal.
