In most animals, dental decay is a rare problem. In man, and especially in the affluent West, the disease has reached epidemic proportions. 
The cause of tooth decay in human beings is a bacterium that feeds on the sugar in our food. It digests the sugar more easily by converting it into an acid. The acid then dissolves the enamel, the outer coating of the teeth, and finally attacks the living nerve within. The result is the agonizing pain we know as toothache.
