<TITLE>PART 4: READING COMPREHENSION / DIRECTIONS: Read the passage carefully and choose the correct answer.

<TEXT>
If you want to take the whole family on holiday and keep everybody happy, then I have found just the place for you. I recently went with a group of friends to stay at the Greenwood Holiday Village, which is open from May until October. 
Built in the centre of a forest, Greenwood is a great place to stay whatever the weather. Its main attraction for families is the indoor World of Water, whether young and old can have fun in different pools. Some of these, however, are for serious swimmers. 
For sporty people, the Country Club offers tennis, squash and badminton. If your children are too young to join in these sports, there are activity clubs. Greenwood is a good place for families and it is traffic-free – you explore on foot or bike. Some people complained that this was inconvenient, but I was pleased to be out in the fresh air. For evening entertainment, there are shows and cinemas. 
Accommodation is in a variety of apartments of different sizes. These have up to four bedrooms, a kitchen and a bathroom, as well as a dining area. Before going, I thought the apartments might not be big enough for all of us, but I was pleasantly surprised – it was not too crowded at all. 
I definitely go back to Greenwood next year. Why don't you give it a try? Visit their website for further information now.
